## The challenge
For this exercise we are challenged to consolidate our CSS knowledge by building two full CSS integrations in the form of interfaces. 
This is an exercise in precision and accuracy where we are demanded to re-create two views pixel-perfectly.

### Interface 1 
In the first integration I used the css flexbox properties to make a card layout using a main container and nesting the boxes within.
To make the boxes responsive for smaller screens I used media queries.
Important takeaways: to equally size the images make one of the width or height properties 'auto'. Also it is important to use a logical width 
for the boxes so that the space is maximised without going over borders. To ensure this, add margins and padding to the main container and boxes. 

### Interface 2
In the second integration I used standard css with flexbox properties in a column. It was very tricky to achieve the exact pixel perfect layouts
as required and maybe it is a better idea to work with a utility framework like Tailwind.
