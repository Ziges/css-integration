## The challenge
For this exercise we are challenged to consolidate our CSS knowledge by building two full CSS integrations in the form of interfaces. 
This is an exercise in precision and accuracy where we are demanded to re-create two views pixel-perfectly.

### Interface 1 
In the first integration exercise I used the css flexbox properties to make a card layout using a main container and nesting the boxes within.
To make the boxes responsive for smaller screens I used media queries.
Important takeaways: to equally size the images make one of the width or height properties 'auto'. Also it is important to use a logical width 
for the boxes so that the space is maximised without going over borders. To ensure this, add margins and padding to the main container and boxes. 

### Interface 2
In the second integration exercise I used box-standard css to style the container div with 3 nested elements: 2 div's and a footer. 
It was very tricky to achieve the exact pixel perfect layouts as required. I got very close, except for the HR line which in a < tr > tag I was unable to draw 
the entire line without splits. 

With hindsight, it may have been a better idea to work with a CSS utility framework like Tailwind.
